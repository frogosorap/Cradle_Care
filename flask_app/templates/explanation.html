						<h2>Ambient Light Sensor</h2>
						<p>
							The Ambient Light Sensor is a high-performance sensor designed to
							measure ambient light levels in lumens. This sensor can measure
							light levels from 0 to 200,000 lux (200klx), making it suitable
							for a variety of lighting conditions, from very low light to
							direct sunlight. Based on the setting the parent chooses , the
							device will have an acceptable threshold. It will check the light
							level of the room roughly every 3 minutes and based on it will
							adjust the curtains accordingly.

						<h2>Sound sensor</h2>
						<p>
							The sound sensor will have a basic threshold, which can be further
							changed by the user. After that point, whenever the sensor detects
							a noise above that threshold it will send a notification to the
							users device indicating a loud noise was detected.
